<!--GH pages always serve 404.html for unknown paths.
    In our case this does an instant redirect because we have
    a 404.html file GH pages looks at. This is just a hack
    when the 404 page is hit, it redirects to the '/' page. React
    router kicks in and recognizes the path in the URL - i.e., /terms or /privacy.
    Since it understands what those routes are, it loads those pages.
