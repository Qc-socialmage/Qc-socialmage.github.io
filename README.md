**Development:**
<br />
1. Clone the repository 
2. > cd repo-name
3. **Install dependencies**
4. > npm install
    - This command should read the package.json file and install all necessary packages, including Vite, React, Tailwind CSS and others
**Start dev server**
   - this will allow you to see what the page should look like in production. 
5. > npm run dev
   - This will start the Vite development server. By default, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173 . Make sure you are using a compatible version of node by checking 
   > node -v

**Building and deploying**
<br/>

- There are scripts located in the package.json folder that make the build and deploy process easy. The two main commands you'll need are: 
    > npm run predeploy
    > npm run deploy 

- See package.json for details

Happy coding
